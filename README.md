# Data Collection and Web Scaping Analysis




## Description
The project involved two main tasks:  Part 1: Mars News Scraping  Utilizing Splinter and Beautiful Soup, automated browsing was conducted to extract HTML code from the Mars news site. Titles and preview text of news articles were scraped and stored in a list of dictionaries.  Part 2: Mars Weather Data Analysis  Mars weather data was scraped using Pandas or a combination of Splinter and Beautiful Soup, forming a structured DataFrame. Analysis included determining the number of Martian months and days, identifying months with the lowest/highest average temperatures and atmospheric pressures, and estimating the number of terrestrial days in a Martian year within a 25% margin of error. The DataFrame was exported to a CSV file for further analysis.
